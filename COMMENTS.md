Instructions
============

* To run the project

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rackup
```

* To run the specs

```
$ bundle exec rspec spec/
```

Comments
========

* I normally use rvm for development. The project contains .ruby-version and .ruby-gemset files,
  which should allow the above commands to be run without 'bundle exec' for convenience.
